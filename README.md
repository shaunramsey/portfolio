# Portfolio of Fun Renders

These are just fun images/animations from different renders throughout the years. The concept of fun or interesting applies to me - so your mileage may vary. I'll do my best to contextualize their creation.

March 2025
 Played around with raymarching and fragment shaders today. Produced some fun images.

I used shadertoy to produce these images via a fragment shader. I did not fine tune the depth (although perhaps it does not need it?).
Some code was taken from: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsB3Rm



Old Work early 2000s

Terrain Compression Using Wavelets. The left image is the original and the right uses 5% of the coefficients

Ray Tracing with BRDFs using Ashikhmin's anisotropic phong BRDF

Photon Mapping with ray traced images using 100 rays per pixel.

In order these are: 1x1 Texels w/ 100k photons, 10x10 Texels with 100k photons and 200x200 Texels with 100m photons.
