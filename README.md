These are just fun images I've made or algorithms I've toyed around with. I'll do my best to contextualize their creation in the readmes.

March 2025
 Played around with raymarching and fragment shaders today. Produced some fun images.

I used shadertoy to produce these images via a fragment shader. I did not fine tune the depth (although perhaps it does not need it?).
Some code was taken from: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsB3Rm
