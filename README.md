# Portfolio of Fun Renders

These are just fun images/animations from different renders throughout the years. The concept of fun or interesting applies to me - so your mileage may vary. I'll do my best to contextualize their creation.

March 2025
 Played around with raymarching and fragment shaders today. Produced some fun images.

<img src="raymarchimage.png" width="200">
<img src="raymarchimage2.png" width="200">

I used shadertoy to produce these images via a fragment shader. I did not fine tune the depth (although perhaps it does not need it?).
Some code was taken from: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsB3Rm
