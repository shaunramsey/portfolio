I have a host of other development that I find interesting. My mobile (and web) development projects with [Dartek Solutions](https://darteksolutions.org/) and the [applications](https://apps.apple.com/tj/developer/dartek-solutions-llc/id1582313944) that I have built for my company are largely not rendering in nature. So, those links will focus more on mobile development and front-facing for the applications we've built. 

Sometimes I've done some development for my own purposes. Early on in KSP's history I built [this calculator](http://cthulhudreams.us/ksp/) to tackle some delta v computations. Some of that moved in game or was done completely in mods. The UX on this is quite awful, but it was tucked away and hidden meant only for me to muck about - so if you're trying to use it, yikes!

I have a myriad of websites and webdev over the years ranging from custom systems for TTRPGs. Most of these are built for me and 3-4 friends, so judge them lightly as they were certainly meant as tools and not as end-user sites with great UX and the like. Some examples include.

- [clockwork cards](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/) using a mechanic from Clockwork Dominion TTRPG.
- [stealing stories](https://stealing-stories.web.app/) for characters in Stealing Stories For the Devil.

I even have some tucked away and hiding for my own designs. Some examples include:
- [schema](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/schema/schema.html) - a TTPRG of my own design around modern magic
- [dreams](http://cthulhudreams.us/) a website dedicated to some fate games and some short story text.
