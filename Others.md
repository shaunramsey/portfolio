# Other Development I Find Interesting

As with the rendering page, this page includes different development projects that are of interest to me and your mileage may vary. Also, this is mostly just going to be a page of links. You'll find a bunch of breadcrumbs of different projects I poked and prodded at varying times. Most of these development projects need a little UX love, as I love to play around and get things working and leave the cleaning up for later. These are also not really meant to be public facing, but I thought I would try to find a place to expose them all so that others can know what I've found interesting to work on over time. Dates posted are approximate, but they should be accurate.

I have a host of other development that I find interesting. My mobile (and web) development projects with [Dartek Solutions](https://darteksolutions.org/) and the [applications](https://apps.apple.com/tj/developer/dartek-solutions-llc/id1582313944) that I have built for my company are largely not rendering in nature. These applications are built with students (or recently graduated students). The Dartek links will focus more on mobile development and front-facing for the applications we've built. These projects are all currently under development or began in the 2020s.

My dive into 'modern' mobile development probably began with a pair of apps built for the very first ipad release in 2010. I built flag assault with a few students and avie flowers alone. I think these links are probably all that remains of them:
- [avie flowers](http://shaunramsey.com/avieflowers/) - a drawing app that could allow you to build fractal-like strikes with a few swipes - rather complete painting application with some extra layers for the fractalization
- [flag assault](http://shaunramsey.com/flagassault/) - a turn-based game where you captured resources and battled - with some bluetooth multiplayer or you could compete against an AI.

Later I'd bring a team to NASA Space Apps Challenge in 2017. We built a couple of apps to submit for that challenge [here](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth-and-us/you-are-my-sunshine/teams/dream-team-1). You can see an example screen that pulls in real solar data and balances the energy consumption against incoming power and, hey, we were a global nominee as a local people's choice winner. <img src="https://github.com/shaunramsey/SolarEnergyPlanner/blob/master/device-2017-05-04-234456.png" width="200">

Sometimes I've done some development for my own purposes. I built [this calculator](http://cthulhudreams.us/ksp/) for KSP around 2015 to tackle some delta v and transfer computations. Some of that moved in game or was done completely in mods but I do so love to play games vanilla. The UX on this is quite awful, but it was tucked away and hidden meant only for me to muck about - so if you're trying to use it, yikes!

Kid got into playing with the Rubik's Cube. So I built a small timer to track his progress in 2022. It also let's you compare with other folks using the timer. If you check this out, don't laugh at my horrible cube solve times. That is tucked away [here](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/cube/ref.html). It's amazing to watch him solve a cube in sub 20s!

I have a myriad of websites and webdev over the years that are meant to tackle different things for TTRPGs. Most of these are built for me and 3-4 friends, so judge them lightly as they were certainly meant as tools and not as end-user sites with great UX and the like. Some examples include:


- [stealing stories](https://stealing-stories.web.app/) for characters in Stealing Stories For the Devil. Built very early in 2023.
- [schema](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/schema/schema.html) - a TTPRG of my own design around modern magic. Built around 2020 or so.
- [clockwork cards](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/) using a mechanic from Clockwork Dominion TTRPG. Built in 2020 or so.
- [dreams](http://cthulhudreams.us/) a website dedicated to some fate games and some short story text. Built around 2014. It was an exploration into php dev.
