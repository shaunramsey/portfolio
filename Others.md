I have a host of other development that I find interesting. My projects with [Dartek Solutions](https://darteksolutions.org/) and the [applications](https://apps.apple.com/tj/developer/dartek-solutions-llc/id1582313944) that I have built for my company are largely not rendering in nature - and focus more on mobile development. 


I have a myriad of websites and webdev over the years ranging from custom systems for TTRPGs. Most of these are built for me and 3-4 friends, so judge them lightly as they were certainly meant as tools and not as end-user sites with great UX and the like. Some examples include.

- [clockwork cards](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/) using a mechanic from Clockwork Dominion TTRPG.
- [stealing stories](https://stealing-stories.web.app/) for characters in Stealing Stories For the Devil.

I even have some tucked away and hiding for my own designs (like [schema](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/schema/schema.html)).
