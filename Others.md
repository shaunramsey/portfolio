I have a host of other development that I find interesting. My mobile (and web) development projects with [Dartek Solutions](https://darteksolutions.org/) and the [applications](https://apps.apple.com/tj/developer/dartek-solutions-llc/id1582313944) that I have built for my company are largely not rendering in nature. So, those links will focus more on mobile development and front-facing for the applications we've built. 

My dive into 'modern' mobile development probably began with a pair of games built for the very first ipad release in 2010. I built flag assault with a few students and avie flowers alone. I think these links are probably all that remains of them:
- [avie flowers](http://shaunramsey.com/avieflowers/) - a drawing app that could allow you to build fractal-like strikes with a few swipes - rather complete painting application
- [flag assault](http://shaunramsey.com/flagassault/) - a turn-based game where you captured resources and battled - with some bluetooth multiplayer or you could compete against an AI.

Later I'd bring a team to NASA Space Apps Challenge in 2017. We built a couple of apps to submit for that challenge [here](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth-and-us/you-are-my-sunshine/teams/dream-team-1/stream). You can see <img src="https://github.com/shaunramsey/SolarEnergyPlanner/blob/master/device-2017-05-04-234456.png" width="200">

Sometimes I've done some development for my own purposes. Early on in KSP's history I built [this calculator](http://cthulhudreams.us/ksp/) to tackle some delta v computations. Some of that moved in game or was done completely in mods. The UX on this is quite awful, but it was tucked away and hidden meant only for me to muck about - so if you're trying to use it, yikes!

Kid got into playing with the Rubik's Cube. So I built a small timer to track his progress. It also let's you compare with other folks using the timer. If you check this out, don't laugh at my horrible cube solve times. That is tucked away [here](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/cube/ref.html). It's amazing to watch him solve a cube in sub 20s!

I have a myriad of websites and webdev over the years ranging from custom systems for TTRPGs. Most of these are built for me and 3-4 friends, so judge them lightly as they were certainly meant as tools and not as end-user sites with great UX and the like. Some examples include.

- [clockwork cards](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/) using a mechanic from Clockwork Dominion TTRPG.
- [stealing stories](https://stealing-stories.web.app/) for characters in Stealing Stories For the Devil.

I even have some tucked away and hiding for my own designs. Some examples include:
- [schema](https://clockworkcards2.web.app/schema/schema.html) - a TTPRG of my own design around modern magic
- [dreams](http://cthulhudreams.us/) a website dedicated to some fate games and some short story text.
